This was compiled while using the tf14py37 conda/python env. Note this includes opencv 4.1 so it is not clear to me if all the linking was done using the wrong include files

follow up: on ubuntu 20.04
apt install opencv python-opencv cmake build-essential
# includes gcc-9  (9.3.0)

nvidia 450 driver
cudatoolkit runfile 11.0

use_cuda11.0 .bashrc function
